       "\"once there lived a poor servant girl   her days were long and grueling—filled with the most tiresome and tedious chores   scrubbing floors  washing clothes  dusting shelves  and cooking meals   cinderella in rags on hands and knees scrubbing the floor chores jobs   she was made to work from dawn until dusk without a single penny in return for her long-suffering hardship   it was the most terrible injustice   you see  her mother had died and her father soon remarried  but his new wife was a simply wretched woman  and she had—from a previous marriage—two equally wretched daughters of her own   they would tease the poor girl dreadfully each day  and one day  while she swept the cinders from the fire  they taunted her and chanted   “cinders… cinders… sweep sweep sweep  in those rags in which you sleep  from this day your name will be  cinderella… hee… hee… hee!’”  cinderella servant girl on step ladder dusting the shelves horrible jobs the two ugly nasty sisters pulling faces   and—sure enough—from that day forward the servant girl’s real name was forgotten and she became known across the land as cinderella   she was a meek and mild-natured young lady   despite years of torment from her wicked step-mother and beastly step-sisters  she did not once raise her voice to them or try to avenge them  nor did she wish them ill   she simply continued with her duties in the hope that one day—when she was older—she would escape and live the wonderful life of which she had often dreamed   one day  came a knock on the door   cinderella opened it   in front of her stood a small  rotund man dressed in royal regalia  carrying an important looking scroll  behind him stood two armoured knights flying flags embossed with the king’s arms   the little man unrolled the scroll and began to read aloud   two armoured knights holding flags with man wearing crown and royal clothing reading aloud from a long scroll  “it is my duty to announce ” he said  formally  “that his majesty the king sends forth an invitation  to all the young ladies of this fine kingdom to attend the royal ball at the palace ”  hearing this  the step-sisters ran to the door and pushed cinderella aside   “oh goodie!” they cried  clapping their hands with delight   the little man continued   “the prince—and heir to the throne—seeks a princess  and he would like to meet each lady of the kingdom in the hope of finding true love  the palace doors will open at 8 p m  this saturday ”  the little man then turned  mounted his horse and galloped off—followed closely by the two knights   the step-sisters closed the door and—not able to contain their excitement—let out an almighty shriek   the step-mother entered   “what is the meaning of all this hilarity?” she cried   “oh… mamma… we have been invited to the royal ball and i feel sure that one of us will be picked as the new princess ”  “of course you will ” replied the step-mother  breaking into a hideous smile  “what prince would not want to marry my precious little munchkins ”  the two ugly sisters dancing around having fun  cinderella watched on  desperately trying to avoid a fit of the giggles  for she knew—as it was plain for all to see—that any prince would rather have lived a life of solitude than marry either of these wretched  selfish brutes   the step-mother turned to cinderella   “prepare the gowns!” she hollered   cinderella nodded   “of course  ma’am ”  you have to know that cinderella longed—more than anything—to go to the ball  but she daren’t ask her wicked step-mother  for she already knew the answer  and she didn’t want to hear it  so she simply busied herself for the following days with her chores and  of course  preparing her step-sisters’ ball gowns   the evening of the royal ball arrived   a splendid horse-drawn carriage pulled up to the front door  and the step-sisters—adorned in their painstakingly hand-stitched gowns—promptly climbed aboard   cinderella looked on with great sadness as the carriage set off down the drive towards the palace   she sighed deeply   “if only i had a single wish ” she said to herself  “i would attend the royal ball and—for just one night—be spared my frightful chores ”  suddenly  there was a flash   a tiny fairy appeared in front of cinderella—hovering like a hummingbird at cinderella’s eye level and clasping a tiny wand   cinderella in her rags looking up at her fairy godmother  “and you shall ” said the fairy   “shall what?” cinderella replied  looking confused   “you shall have your wish  for i am your fairy godmother  oh how you have suffered in silence all these years  you are a kind soul  a mild and gracious young lady  and you shall go to the ball  your wish—my dearest cinderella—is my command ”  cinderella beamed   “oh my ” she exclaimed  with glee   then she stopped—and a frown came upon her face   “but i am not prepared  fairy godmother  my clothes are threadbare  and my shoes are tattered  i cannot possibly attend the palace like this ”  “worry not  cinderella ” said the fairy godmother  with a smile   “for all i will need to grant your wish is a pumpkin  a rat  two mice and four grasshoppers ”  a big orange pumpkin a rat two mice and four green grasshoppers  cinderella looked mystified   “hurry along then  dear ”  and she did   first  cinderella went to the garden and returned with a large  ripe pumpkin  the fairy godmother tapped it once with her wand and—in an instant—it transformed into a majestic  golden carriage   then  she went to a trap in the kitchen and returned with a rat   “excellent  dear ” said the fairy godmother  “now  if you wouldn’t mind just placing it on the coachman’s seat for me ”  cinderella obliged   another swoosh of the wand and  this time  a resplendent coachman appeared  the two mice—which cinderella found in the pantry—were turned into two smartly attired footmen  and the four grasshoppers into four magnificent white horses   cinderella's beautiful golden carriage with coachman white horses and footmen  “and now ” said the fairy godmother  “for my final touch ”  she tapped cinderella’s shoulder with her wand   a spark flew up   the ragged clothes in which she stood a moment earlier were replaced with a picture of sublime elegance—cinderella in a magical  sparkling ball gown fit for a princess  and  upon her feet  the finest pair of shimmering glass slippers that your eyes could behold   cinderella in her sparkling ball gown and shimmering glass slippers  “sensational!” exclaimed the fairy godmother   “but remember ” she said  shortly  “as the clock strikes midnight this magic spell will be broken and your clothes will return to rags ”  “i understand ” said cinderella  kissing her fairy godmother on the cheek  “and a thousand thank yous for your wonderful kindness ”  cinderella stepped into the carriage  then—with a single swish of the coachman’s reins—the horse-drawn  golden carriage departed for the royal ball   a trumpet sounded as the golden carriage drew up at the palace gates   cinderella received a royal welcome   lords bowed low   ladies curtsied   and many heads turned as she entered the ballroom—including that of the prince  who was immediately struck by cinderella’s elegance and the warmth of her smile   the prince approached   “m’lady ” he said  bowing his head slowly and offering his hand  “would you be so kind as to take my first dance?”  “i would be delighted ” said cinderella   she could feel her cheeks beginning to blush as she accompanied the prince to the dancefloor   the orchestra began to play   cinderella in beautiful gown happy dancing with happy prince  every eye in the ballroom was upon them—including those of her step-sisters  but  such was her transformation  they simply didn’t recognise her  instead  they stared in envy  longing to take her place before the prince   but they never did   from that moment forth  the prince had only eyes for cinderella  the two of them spent the whole evening dancing in each other’s arms and greatly enjoying each other’s company   many hours drifted by   9 p m   10 p m   11 p m   suddenly  cinderella looked up at the clock—it was 11:59 p m and she only had one minute before the magic spell was broken   “oh  i must go ” she said to the prince   without delay  she darted out of the room  past the guards and through the palace  but—as she reached the hall—she lost one of her glass slippers  and in her haste to get away  she left it   clock striking twelve midnight cinderella running away from the ball lost glass slipper  alas!  the clock struck midnight   cinderella found no coach outside the palace  only a pumpkin  even the rat  mice and grasshoppers were nowhere to be seen  and now—clad in her original rags—cinderella had no choice but to run home alone in the darkness of the night   a few days passed   cinderella returned to her daily chores  and her step-sisters continued their relentless beastliness towards her   everything was back to normal   the evening of the royal ball began to blur and fade in cinderella’s mind like a magical dream   had the pumpkin really turned into a golden carriage?  and the rat into a coachman?  had she really danced all night with the prince—as her step-sister's watched on in envy?  she was beginning to doubt it   suddenly  came a rap upon the door  cinderella opened it   in front of her stood the same round little man that'd announced the royal ball—the same two knights behind him as before   “i present ” he said  triumphantly  “his majesty the prince ”  a trumpet sounded and the armoured knights parted to reveal the prince  holding a sparkling glass slipper—the very same slipper that had escaped cinderella’s foot as she fled the palace a few nights earlier   cinderella’s eyes widened   “it really happened ” she thought to herself   she locked eyes with the prince and held his gaze for a moment  not for long—but enough time for him to know the lady with whom he had danced that magical night was standing before him   all of a sudden came the heavy stomping of feet and the step-sisters came rushing to the door—barging cinderella aside so hard she nearly lost her footing   the little man continued   “his majesty is visiting every home in the land to find the rightful owner of this glass slipper  the foot that fits this shoe belongs to the lady that he will ask to marry ”  the sisters yelped with excitement   now  at this point  the prince already knew that the sisters’ feet would not fit the shoe  but he had not the heart to tell them  so—for the following ten minutes—a quite ridiculous charade took place as the sisters  in turn  tried on the slipper   the first sister’s foot was so wide that it barely made it halfway in  and—to avoid the slipper shattering under the pressure being exerted upon it—the little man was forced to intervene   first ugly sister struggling trying on glass slipper too small  the second sister had more luck  she eventually managed to compress her foot into the slipper  only for the sides of her foot to spill over the edges like a river bursting its banks   second ugly sister struggling trying on glass slipper too small  then came the turn of cinderella   the sisters’ scoffed in unison at the mere thought of cinderella—in her threadbare rags—trying on such an elegant shoe   the prince stepped forward with a knowing look in his eye  knelt down and carefully slid the glass slipper on cinderella’s foot   the prince smiled   “a perfect fit!” he said   prince holding cinderella's hand helping to try on glass slipper a perfect fit  without a moment’s hesitation cinderella reached into the pocket of her ragged servant’s dress  then—bending slowly forward—she placed the matching slipper upon her other foot   “a matching pair ” exclaimed the prince with delight  “there is no doubt that you  cinderella  are my one true love  i have not been able to stop thinking about you  would you do me the grand honour of becoming my wife?”  cinderella looked upon her rags and then back to the prince   “i am but a poor servant ” she said   “you are ” replied the prince  “a princess in my eyes  and it matters not to me of the clothes upon your back  for we share something more valuable than the gold of a thousand kingdoms…”  he looked longingly into cinderella’s eyes and said   “we share love ”  ~~~  happy cinderella and happy prince together  i am pleased to say that cinderella gladly accepted the prince’s proposal and—shortly after—they were married  before long  they ruled as king and queen  and dedicated their lives to the happiness and prosperity of the people in their wonderful kingdom   \""
